            <p>Vannevar Bush, "As We May Think," Atlantic Monthly, released July 1945.</p>
            <p>From the imagined classification and working methods introduced to us by Vannevar Bush, there are very interesting thinking directions that correlates with some properties of our search engine nowadays and our research methodology. It is understandable from his point of view that the traditional library system at his age have its own limitation that renders the access to data veryy difficult, namely because the libraries are based on the index system. As he mentionned, the human mind operates by association, and several paths are connecting the same knowledge, thus what he proposed was a memex machine that mechanises the selection by association, and the same content can be accessed in different ways.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <p>Some of the examples mentioned by him have intriguing resemblance to what we know as navigation system, and similar concepts of a navigation bar, backward and forward properties, return to home page capacity are presented. In his article he also mentioned having different items grouped and joined, just like a trail, so everytime one element of the trail has been accessed the others ones will automatically appear for further consultation. This idea is very similar to the youtube recommendation list, among others, and its efficiency has been proven. Some other capacities of the memex machine, such as annotation and key points documentation, can also be seen in web editors like pdfs, word documents, etc. </p>
            <p>As a conclusion, Bush went ahead its time by re-visiting the mechanisms of human navigation methods, which are user-friendly.</p>

            <p>Roy Rosenzweig, Writing the history of the internet</p>
            <p>In Roy Rosenzweig’s Writing the history of the internet, he suggested that the active authors/players of the internet’s creation are in fact the netizens who democratized the web. The distinction between how the internet functions and how any other real-life system works is mainly based on the equal share of the tools to edit the website and the right to share changes, in the sense that anyone, regardless of their social status, could bring out change and shape the web. The internet is seen, in this way, as a bottom-up approach where rules and regulations are only applied to existing publications, and they do not aim to intervene nor to limit the content to be published.

        </article>
        <article>
            <p> This approach allowed a fast-expanding development of the internet, partially because networking has been employed as a tool to decentralize technology and to offer a new non-hierarchical conception of society. As mentioned in the article, in the 60s and the 80s, there was an anti-hierarchical cultural revolution and an anti-statist political revolution, that located the internet as a place for netizens to celebrate freedom. On the other side of the internet, however, with the marketization of internet technologies, giant companies have installed on the web and are controlling what people see and say to turn in their favor. A few examples will be the collection of personal data, suggested information visibility, and censoring of certain opinions/sectors.

            <p>The Social Dilemma (2020)</p>
            <p>In the Netflix documentary “The Social Dilemma”, the topic on large social media platforms is discussed and elaborated on. The show invited former employees of some of the mainstream platforms to flip the other side of the coin and reveal the mechanism behind the system. In the documentary, many warn us about the potential danger or the backside of what we are offered. Three main factors are talked about in the documentary: who is the product, addiction, and manipulation. 
            </p>
            <p>Those big platforms are free in appearance, but they are generating considerable wealth from their users. In fact, the users are the fuel to be consumed for the expansion of the platform because popularity and attention have power and are marketable. By selling your personal preference and information, those platforms can attract other micro-sellers who are paying to reach their target public. This leads to another aspect of the documentary, which is manipulation. A way to do it is by binding the users to the application by inflicting addiction on them. As the documentary mentioned, social media is not a tool, a tool is silent and doing only what has been asked for, a social media in itself seeks to make a profit out of its consumers, thus it offers a service but will take something back in return.  
            </p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <p>In order to generate addiction in the users, social media will often generate contents that condition the brain to repeat the same action. Those individual contents are often quick to read and easy to understand, which conditions the brain to get used to scrolling and constantly looking at those content. By providing you with a certain type of information and content, those platforms have the power to manipulate how you react to certain ideas or actions. In the long run, social media is creating an environment for you that you may not have many controls over. For example, all the notifications one can receive from social media can gradually lead one’s attention that way, and the similarity between the shown content increases one’s exposure to that type of content. Once this familiarity is established, a new business path is created and established with you. 
            </p>
            <p> There is work to be done to fix those issues, but it is a progressive process and should start with us.

            <p>“Thank You, Black Twitter”: State Violence, Digital Counterpublics, and Pedagogies of Resistance</p>
            <p>In the article on Tweeting, Hill examined the role of Black Twitter as a platform that enabled resistance against anti-Black violence in the US. The author has looked up ways the Black community has collaborated over Twitter to raise awareness on the topic and to reject the marginalization, systemic oppression, and surveillance that have been applied to the community.  The article concentrated on the case of Ferguson, where a young Black male has been killed by a police officer. The corpse has been then left on the ground for more than four hours. 
            </p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <p> During the event, Twitter hashtags such as #MichaelBrown, #Ferguson, and #HandsUpDontShoot gained significant attention on the network and quickly became an international cause that re-initiated the discussion around the anti-majoritarian narrative and the negotiation of oppositional parties. Hill characterizes this use of Twitter as a “counter-public” by which critical pedagogy and mass resistance are organized. The examples shown contrasted with the previous reading that concentrated on the manipulative aspects of social media, as the cases of counter-public employment of Twitter have significant humanitarian values and offer a direction towards a better-serving social media landscape.

            <p>Everything is a Remix Remastered (2015 HD)</p>
            <p>In the reading topics of week 9, the topics of remixing are discussed through the examples of the GNU (Gnu's Not Unix) manifesto, and a series of other copyright issues around remixing from the youtube video Everything is a Remix Remastered. Dilemma around copyright has always existed since the start, as the forensic use of copyright has only been commonly seen in recent decades, and the balance between genre and authenticity is often fluctuating. The reading materials take me to wonder about the limitations and protections copyright can offer to content creators. 
            </p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <p> As the video mentioned, creation is a re-creation based on previous examples. Having the capacity to use previous works as a reference and building stone is an important step in the development of a better cultural sector (in the case of Fine Arts). From all the examples shown, it seems that opening a more acceptant and with fewer limitations to follow will favor the production growth and push for the creation of new ideas. When it comes to the reasons behind copyright, they appear to rather be monetary. So I think unless the society’s structure and the definition of intellectual property have witnessed enough discussions and adaptations, those issues revolving around the use of copyright will remain hard to be balanced.
