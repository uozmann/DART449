            <p>Vannevar Bush, "As We May Think," Atlantic Monthly, released July 1945.</p>
            <p>From the imagined classification and working methods introduced to us by Vannevar Bush, there are very interesting thinking directions that correlates with some properties of our search engine nowadays and our research methodology. It is understandable from his point of view that the traditional library system at his age have its own limitation that renders the access to data veryy difficult, namely because the libraries are based on the index system. As he mentionned, the human mind operates by association, and several paths are connecting the same knowledge, thus what he proposed was a memex machine that mechanises the selection by association, and the same content can be accessed in different ways.</p>

            <p>Some of the examples mentioned by him have intriguing resemblance to what we know as navigation system, and similar concepts of a navigation bar, backward and forward properties, return to home page capacity are presented. In his article he also mentioned having different items grouped and joined, just like a trail, so everytime one element of the trail has been accessed the others ones will automatically appear for further consultation. This idea is very similar to the youtube recommendation list, among others, and its efficiency has been proven. Some other capacities of the memex machine, such as annotation and key points documentation, can also be seen in web editors like pdfs, word documents, etc. </p>
            <p>As a conclusion, Bush went ahead its time by re-visiting the mechanisms of human navigation methods, which are user-friendly.</p>

            <p>Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack (forming part of most South-Sea-men's cabin furniture), and pointing it towards Starbuck, exclaimed: "There is one God that is Lord over the earth, and one Captain that is lord over the Pequod.&mdash;On deck!"</p>
			<p>For an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery cheeks, you would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of the levelled tube. But, mastering his emotion, he half calmly rose, and as he quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and said: "Thou hast outraged, not insulted me, sir; but for that I ask thee not to beware of Starbuck; thou wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab beware of Ahab; beware of thyself, old man."</p>
			<p>"He waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery that!" murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared. "What's that he said&mdash;Ahab beware of Ahab&mdash;there's something there!" Then unconsciously using the musket for a staff, with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed, and returning the gun to the rack, he went to the deck.</p>
